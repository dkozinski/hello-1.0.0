## Abstract Data Type (ADT)

An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a type whose behavior is defined by a set of value and a set of opertations.
The definition of ADT only mention what operations are performed, not how these operations will be implemented.

It is called "abstract" because it gives an implementation-independent view.

### Exaples of abstract data types include

* lists
* stacks
* trees
* queues

## Creating a new ADT

* You have to provide a way to store the data
  * usually by designing a structure
* You have to provide ways of manipulating the data
  * adding, deleting, etc.

### 3-step process

* provide an abstract description of the type's properties of the operations you can perform on the type
  * not tied to any particular implementation
* develop a programming interface that implements the ADT
  * indictate how to store the data
  * describe a set of functions that perform the desired operations
